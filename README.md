# hierarchical_decode
🎯 Introduction

A hierarchical decoder is a larger decoder constructed using smaller decoders. This modular approach improves reusability and readability.

Let’s build a 3-to-8 decoder using two 2-to-4 decoders and one 1-to-2 decoder as the enable control.

🏅 Advantages of Hierarchical Decoders:

✅ Modularity: Smaller decoders are reusable.

✅ Readability: Easier to understand large designs.

✅ Scalability: Extend to larger decoders easily.


🎯 Applications:

Address decoding in memory chips.

Control signals in microprocessors.

I/O port selection.

Data routing in communication systems.
